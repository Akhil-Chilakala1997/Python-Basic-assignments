    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "# functions can be  used in our programe  to make our code  simple and readble.it allows  us to  reduce \n",
    "# the repetitive  lines of code.For example  if you  want to  perform  some lines of code  repeatedly  you  can put those\n",
    "# line inside the  function  and just  call the function  whenever required.so  this makes code  simpler and easier and \n",
    "# saves the time and effort to the programmers \n",
    "\n",

    "2.When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "#The code in function  runs  when  it is called\n",

    "4.What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "# A function when  it is defined  tell  us what  it is going to  perform so  this part is\n",
    "# called functon defintion .function  call is used to  call  the function when it is required so  when\n",

    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "# A local scope is created whenever a function is called. Any variables assigned in this \n",
    "# function exist within the local scope. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed, \n",
    "# and these variables are forgotten.\n",

    "7.What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "# After performing some actions on variables the result can be passed to  function call  through return \n",
    "# statement which a variable is used to  catch  it.we can also  have expression in return statement.\n",
    "8.If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "# None\n",
    "9.How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "#just declare Global keyword infront of that variable\n",

    "14.What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "#try  clause is use to write our code .if try  clause encounter the  error  ,except clause catch it\n",
